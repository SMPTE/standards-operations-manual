      <h2>Standards Purpose and Scope</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this Standards Operations Manual is to define
        the duties of Engineering and Standards officers, staff,
        chairs and participants and to define the policies and
        procedures for developing and maintaining
        SMPTE’s <a>Engineering Documents</a>. The primary audience for
        these policies and procedures is the <a>Society</a> staff
        and <a>Society</a> members who monitor or participate in the
        standards development work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>Society</a> is an impartial developer of standards and
        other <a>Engineering Documents</a> in the fields of motion
        images, television, motion pictures, and related
        technology. This work includes all technical aspects of images
        being produced, processed, reproduced, distributed via
        contribution circuits or via storage media, and viewed on a
        screen or emissive display device, including accompanying
        audio, data, metadata, and control signals.
        The <a>Society</a>’s <a>Engineering Documents</a> are designed
        and adopted for the purpose of promoting and furthering the
        interests of the international community.  The existence of
        an <a>Engineering Document</a> of the <a>Society</a> does not
        create an obligation for any <a>Society</a> member or
        nonmember to adhere to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        SMPTE <a>Standards</a> shall be developed in accordance with
        applicable antitrust and competition laws, and meetings
        amongst competitors to develop SMPTE <a>Standards</a> are to
        be conducted in accordance with these laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>Society</a> shall evaluate and document, as
        appropriate, both the needs and applications of new and
        emerging technologies relevant to the fields of motion images,
        television, motion picture, and related
        technologies. The <a>Society</a> shall explore the needs and
        interests brought about by these technologies and shall assume
        a leadership role in any necessary standardization efforts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>Society</a> serves as a registrar of identifiers needed
        by the motion imaging and related industries.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>Society</a> recognizes the importance and acceptance of
        SMPTE <a>Engineering Documents</a> as international
        publications. To maintain this position, the <a>Society</a>
        shall strive to harmonize national <a>engineering document</a>
        development with international activities and to interrelate
        with other <a>engineering document</a> developing
        organizations, drafting committees, and technical
        organizations.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a>Society</a> recognizes and shall maintain its position
        of influence in the deliberations of other standardization
        organizations within the fields of television, motion picture,
        and related technologies. To accomplish this purpose,
        the <a>Society</a> shall maintain its membership and
        administrative roles in such other standardization
        organizations as found appropriate by the <a>Board of
        Governors</a>.

        <p>
          The Standards Community, as described in the
          <a href="https://www.smpte.org/about/policies-and-governance">
           Membership Operations Manual</a>, is collectively all
          members of all <a>Technology Committees</a>. The unqualified
          term, “Member”, refers to members of the Standards
          Community. All Members are subject to this Standards
          Operations Manual and the <a>Administrative Guidelines</a>,
          specifically including all requirements for confidentiality
          (see Section <a href="#Confidentiality-Policy"></a>) and
          observance of the Society’s Intellectual Property Policy
          (see Section
          <a href="#Intellectual-Property-Confidentiality-Policy"></a>). All
          Members shall be individuals who have paid, or have been
          exempted from, the <a>Participation Fee</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applicants for membership shall submit complete appropriate
          contact information as requested by the <a>Director of
          Engineering</a>, all of which shall be subject to the
          Society’s Privacy Policy. All Members shall provide an email
          address. Members shall use the same email address for all
          Committees and <a>Sub Groups</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          All Members are subject to a Participation Agreement. All
          Members are subject to the Society Code of Conduct as
          defined in the
          <a href="https://www.smpte.org/about/policies-and-governance">
           Membership Operations Manual</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Members may terminate their membership in the Standards
          Community (and thus all <a>Technology Committees</a>) with
          written notice to the <a>Director of Engineering</a>.<p>


        <p>
          Membership in the Standards Community may be terminated by
          the <a>Director of Engineering</a> if the Director
          determines that 1) a member’s contact information is not
          current and the member has been non-responsive for 8 weeks
          by email and phone; or 2) failure to pay
          the <a>Participation Fee</a> as required.
        </p>

        <p>
          Membership in the Standards Community also may be terminated
          by the <a>Standards Vice President</a> for serious
          violations of this Standards Operations Manual. The
          following process shall pertain: First, the <a>Standards
          Vice President</a> or Standards Director must have
          personally observed the violations. Second, a written notice
          of violation (which may be via email) must have been sent to
          the Member by the <a>Standards Vice President</a>. If the
          Member then violates this Operations Manual again within one
          year of the notice, at that time, the <a>Standards Vice
          President</a> may terminate the membership in the Standards
          Community by written notification (which may be by email)
          and inform the <a>Board of Governors</a> of the action. The
          terminated Member may appeal to the <a>Board of
          Governors</a> for reinstatement. In any case, a terminated
          Member may apply for membership in the Standards Community
          after a period of one year.

          <p>
            An annual fee (the “<a>Participation Fee</a>”) may be
            assessed for membership in the Standards Community. As
            membership in the Standards Community is open to all
            individuals, there may be a scale of fees based on SMPTE
            membership level or other considerations. Fees are
            established by, and may be waived or prorated by,
            the <a>Director of Engineering</a> based on consideration
            of individual contributions and financial situation.

          <h4>Membership</h4>

          <p>
            Normally, membership in a <a>Sub Group</a> is open to all
            members of the parent Group. However, as all work of
            a <a>Sub Group</a> will be considered later by
            a <a>Technology Committee</a>, <a>Sub Group</a> membership
            may be restricted with the prior approval of
            the <a>Standards Vice President</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a>Sub Groups</a> may seek participation by experts or
            other interested parties who are not Members. Such
            participation shall be at the discretion of the Chair of
            the <a>Sub Group</a> and the <a>Standards Vice
            President</a> and should be permitted only when a
            contribution is needed from someone who would not be
            expected to join the Standards Community. All such
            participants shall submit Statements of Participation and
            shall agree to abide by the requirements of this Standards
            Operations Manual.

          <h4>Procedures</h4>

          <p>
            A <a>Sub Group</a> shall be formed and terminated by the
            Chair of the parent Group in consultation with the parent
            Group. The formation and termination of a <a>Sub Group</a>
            shall be recorded in the minutes of the parent Group.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a>Sub Groups</a> are encouraged, but not required, to
            follow the same requirements for meeting notices and
            agendas as <a>Technology Committees</a>.  A <a>Sub
            Group</a> may adopt less formal procedures and short
            notice periods provided there is <a>Consensus</a> of the
            membership of the <a>Sub Group</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Similarly, meeting reports may be less formal,
            but—particularly where an aggressive meeting schedule
            means that not all members of the <a>Sub Group</a> can
            attend all meetings— it is essential that meeting outcomes
            be reported accurately and promptly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Generally, a <a>Sub Group</a> is expected to achieve
            Consensus on recommendations to its parent Group. In cases
            in which there is no <a>Consensus</a> and the <a>Sub
            Group</a> Chair determines that Consensus is unlikely to
            be reached, the Chair shall refer the matter to the parent
            Group for guidance. The parent Group shall consider
            arguments representing all opinions on the matter for
            which the <a>Sub Group</a> cannot reach <a>Consensus</a>
            and, where appropriate, shall attempt to
            reach <a>Consensus</a> and to instruct the <a>Sub
            Group</a> accordingly.
          </p>

          <p>
            All members of a <a>Sub Group</a> have equal status and
            may participate in all activities of the <a>Sub Group</a>,
            including <a>Consensus</a> determination.

        <h3>General</h3>

        <p>
          All meetings shall be conducted according to the following
          procedures:
        </p>

        <ol type="a">

          <li>
            All <a>Technology Committees</a> shall conduct business in
            accordance with the provisions of this Standards
            Operations Manual and the <a>Administrative
            Guidelines</a>. For matters not covered by these
            documents, "<em>Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised</em>"
            (latest edition) shall apply. All <a>Technology
            Committee</a> Chairs are required to be familiar with
            Robert's Rules.
          </li>

          <li>
            The <a>Technology Committees</a> are permitted to have
            multiple Chairs, but at each meeting only one Chair shall
            act as the meeting Chair.
          </li>

          <li>
            Chairs should make use of electronic meeting tools
            (e.g. phone bridges) when available. When facilities are
            provided for meeting participation by telephone or other
            electronic means, <a>Technology Committee</a> Members
            and <a>Guests</a> so participating shall be considered to
            be present as if they were physically present, including
            for the determination of <a>Quorum</a> and maintenance of
            membership.
          </li>

          <li>
            At least 720 hours (30 days) before the scheduled start
            time of a meeting, the meeting Chair shall distribute a
            meeting call and a draft agenda. Meeting calls shall
            include the start time of the meeting and should include
            an estimated end time. When the start time may be impacted
            by other meetings scheduled earlier on the same day, the
            meeting call should indicate any potential for a
            variance. The meeting Chair shall make a reasonable
            attempt to notify the <a>Membership Body</a> of any
            variance on the day of the meeting. Meetings shall not
            convene before their announced times (as amended within
            any notified variance), but may convene significantly
            after their announced times on the same day. There is no
            requirement that a meeting end at any specific time, even
            if an estimated time is provided.
          </li>

          <li>
            Unless otherwise specifically stated: a) US Eastern Time
            (as modified by Daylight Saving Time at the current SMPTE
            Home Office location) shall be used; and b) when only a
            day is prescribed, deadlines shall be at 23:59:59 on that
            day.
          </li>

          <li>
            An agenda, minutes, or contribution document is
            "distributed" if:

            <ul>
              <li>
                it is emailed as an attachment to the official Group
                email list; or
              </li>
              <li>
                it is deposited on an SMPTE sanctioned Internet server
                with a pointer sent by email as above; or
              </li>
              <li>
                notice is provided by directly contacting each member
                of the Group.

          <li>
            For all <a>Technology Committees</a>, attendance shall be
            recorded according to procedures established by
            the <a>Standards Committee</a>. The attendance list shall
            be used by the <a>Director of Engineering</a> to establish
            membership rights as provided herein and to establish
            agreement to this Standards Operations Manual by all
            attendees. All attendees shall agree to adhere to the
            provisions of this Operations Manual. At the discretion of
            the Chair, other Members may be present in the meeting
            room without being recorded as meeting attendees.
          </li>

          <li>
            For all <a>Technology Committees</a>, Minutes shall be
            prepared by the Secretary and submitted to the Chair no
            more than 30 days after a meeting. The Chair shall review,
            modify as required, and approve the Minutes within 14 days
            of receipt and then shall distribute the Minutes to all
            members of the Group, with a copy to the <a>Director of
            Engineering</a> and the <a>Standards Vice
            President</a>. <a>Guests</a> may request Minutes from
            the <a>Director of Engineering</a>. Meeting attendees may
            suggest changes to the minutes. The Minutes, amended if
            necessary, shall be approved at the next meeting and
            distributed by the Secretary.
          </li>

          <li>
            For decisions on significant questions affecting the
            content of <a>Engineering Documents</a> or motions made in
            any Group, <a>Consensus</a> shall be
            obtained. <a>Consensus</a> shall be determined to exist
            either when there are no objections or when no more than
            1/3 of the <a>Participant Members</a> who respond in favor
            or opposed are opposed. All determinations
            of <a>Consensus</a> shall be recorded in the Minutes. The
            use of "straw polls" and other means of
            achieving <a>Consensus</a> are encouraged.
          </li>

          <li>
            The <a>Society</a> is a technical and scientific
            organization and considers the members of its Committees
            and <a>Sub Groups</a>, and the <a>Guests</a> of its
            meetings, as individual experts and not necessarily as
            representatives of their employing organizations. There
            are, however, occasions during the activities of a Group
            when a formal industry position would materially
            contribute to the resolution of a question. On these
            occasions, a Member or <a>Guest</a> may state that an
            opinion given is that of an organization, and that opinion
            may be so recorded. The Chair may, in addition, solicit
            the views or opinions of appropriate special interests.
          </li>

          <li>
            On any matter before a <a>Technology Committee</a>, where
            the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair considers that
            any <a>Interest Group</a> or corporate entity has caused,
            by sponsoring an unreasonable number of <a>Participant
            Members</a> or otherwise, substantial imbalance, so as to
            affect the outcome of a specific vote, the <a>Technology
            Committee</a> Chair shall report this matter to
            the <a>Standards Committee</a> with a recommendation for
            appropriate corrective action, such as conducting
            a <a>Written Vote</a>. The <a>Standards Committee</a>, by
            a <a>Consensus Vote</a>, may approve the request for
            a <a>Written Vote</a> to override and replace the vote in
            question. It may also recommend other corrective action,
            subject to approval by the <a>Board of Governors</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            In order to assist the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair
            in determining a balance of interests, <a>Participant
            Members</a> should declare at the initial roll call of a
            meeting all entities whose interests they represent at
            that meeting. Further, if they represent more than one
            entity, they should declare which entity they represent
            during each vote (of any kind).
          </li>

          <li>
            The Secretary may electronically record any meeting for
            the purpose of assisting in the preparation of the Minutes
            and subsequent confirmation by the <a>Technology
            Committee</a>. Once the Minutes have been confirmed, the
            recording and all copies shall be destroyed within 14
            days. No person other than the Secretary shall
            electronically record, or assist another person in
            electronically recording any meeting in any form.

          a <a>Quorum</a>. Determination of a <a>Quorum</a> shall be
          conducted at the beginning of each <a>Technology
          Committee</a> meeting. For <a>Sub Groups</a>, those members
          present always shall constitute a <a>Quorum</a>.

          For any vote, a <a>Quorum</a> must be present, whether or
          not a <a>Quorum</a> was present at the beginning of the
          meeting. All votes shall be recorded by the Secretary as a
          tally of the <a>Participant Members</a>. If, as determined
          from the tally, a <a>Quorum</a> is no longer present, then
          the results of the vote shall require confirmation as
          specified below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Per Robert’s Rules, temporary absence of one or
          more <a>Participant Members</a> from the meeting room does
          not constitute loss of a <a>Quorum</a> and the ability to
          conduct business, but the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair
          shall provide reasonable opportunity for <a>Participant
          Members</a> to be summoned prior to a vote.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a <a>Quorum</a> is not present, the meeting may
          continue; however all decisions shall be confirmed by
          the <a>Technology Committee</a> either at its next meeting
          when a <a>Quorum</a> is present or by a <a>Written Vote</a>,

            A <a>Written Vote</a> is a vote conducted among the
            entire <a>Participant Members</a>hip in writing, usually
            via electronic means. A <a>Written Vote</a> has no
            Comments.

          <p>
            A <a>Ballot</a> is a Written <a>Consensus Vote</a> (see
            criteria of section <a href="#Consensus-Vote"></a>) of a
            duration that permits Comments to be submitted. All
            Comments shall subsequently be Resolved as a condition of
            the <a>Participant Member</a>'s vote.
          </p>

          <p>
            A "<dfn data-lt="Comment|Comments">Comment</dfn>" is a
            reference with a statement about what is in error or
            omission, along with a possible resolution. Redlines of a
            document, while helpful and supportive to the process, are
            not acceptable alone as Comments. Redlines, without
            accompanying written description of the error, omission,
            or a request for additional features or functionality,
            need not be considered in the Comment Resolution
            process. Regardless of the vote cast (YES, NO, or
            ABSTAIN), Comments may always be submitted. Comments shall
            be submitted with all NO votes. Any NO vote without
            Comments shall be discarded and counted as
            non-responsive. Comments from all sources are to be
            treated equally.
          </p>

          <p>
            All Comments shall be submitted in English. Comments
            should include a proposed resolution.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be approved, a <a>Ballot</a> shall meet the criteria
            for a <a>Consensus Vote</a> as set forth
            in <a href="#Consensus-Vote"></a> above, and also shall
            have received Yes votes from at least 1/3 of
            the <a>Participant Members</a>.  The latter criterion is
            called Numeric <a>Consensus</a>.  <a>Technology
            Committee</a> Chairs are encouraged to monitor the voting
            on a <a>Ballot</a> during the course of the <a>Ballot</a>
            period and to solicit <a>Participant Members</a> to
            return <a>Ballots</a> if the number of <a>Ballots</a>
            returned is low.  Such solicitations shall not contain any
            comment or opinion on the merits of the document
            being <a>Ballot</a>ed or on how the <a>Participant
            Member</a> ought to vote.
          </p>

          <p>
            The default duration of any <a>Ballot</a> is 5
            weeks. By <a>Consensus</a> of the <a>Technology
            Committee</a>, an alternative duration of no less than
            three weeks may be selected.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a <a>Ballot</a> achieves <a>Consensus</a> but fails to
            achieve Numeric <a>Consensus</a>, the <a>Technology
            Committee</a> Chair may request the <a>Director of
            Engineering</a> to extend the <a>Ballot</a> period for two
            weeks to permit additional <a>Ballots</a> to be returned.
            These additional <a>Ballots</a> shall be added to
            the <a>Ballots</a> received during the duration of the
            original <a>Ballot</a> and the totals examined to
            determine whether <a>Consensus</a> still exists and
            whether Numeric <a>Consensus</a> has been achieved.
            During any such extended <a>Ballot</a>
            period, <a>Participant Members</a> shall have the right
            and ability both to modify votes originally cast and to
            submit additional Comments.

      <h2>Engineering Document Development Procedures</h2>

      <section id='Introduction'>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
          <a>Engineering Documents</a> are created by a two-stage
          process – a Development Phase and an Approval Phase.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Development Phase is conducted by an individual or Group
          and is relatively informal. The intent of this phase is to
          engage all interested parties and to permit exchanges of
          view and iteration of a document without the need for
          cumbersome record keeping. Nevertheless, due process (see
          below) needs to be followed to ensure that all relevant
          views are received and considered. The final step of the
          Development Phase is to circulate a draft document to
          the <a>Technology Committee</a> for informal comment and to
          further iterate the document in response to inputs
          received. If the development phase is successful, little
          change to the document should be necessary in the Approval
          Phase.
        </p>

        <p>
          When a document represents the best available outcome of the
          informal work, the Approval Phase begins. Approval
          procedures are based on Written <a>Ballots</a> to
          the <a>Technology Committee</a> and a formal Comment
          Resolution process, also described below. The Approval Phase
          permits disposition of Comments by <a>Consensus</a> of the
          committee, rather than by full agreement and therefore must
          be fully documented. The Approval Phase forms the formal
          record of the document.

          SMPTE <a>Engineering Document</a> or <a>Registered
          Disclosure Document</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <a>Project</a> may be proposed by any individual. The

          President</a> and appropriate <a>Technology Committee</a>
          Chair(s) to prepare a <a>Project</a> Proposal as described
          below.

          Members are encouraged to offer suggestions for improvement
          of the Proposal; such suggestions are advisory.  At the
          conclusion of the <a>project</a> approval review period,
          the <a>Project</a> <a>Proponent</a>(s) optionally may amend
          the <a>Project Summary</a> in the light of suggestions
          received.  The amended <a>Project Summary</a> shall be
          published within one week of the close of the review period.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a <a>Technology Committee</a> or <a>Standards
          Committee</a> Member believes that substantive changes are
          required to the Scope of the <a>Project</a>, the Member

          two weeks of the start of the <a>project</a> approval
          review, stating precisely the changes proposed.  Absent such
          notification, the <a>Project</a> is approved, and work may
          commence.
        </p>

        <p>
          If changes are proposed, work may continue, but proposed

        <p>
          When a document achieves <a>Committee Draft</a> status,
          the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair shall conduct
          a <a>Ballot</a> (FCD <a>Ballot</a>) asking the question:
          “Should this CD be made a <a>Final Committee

          to Comment, regardless of their votes, with the

          comments according to the Comment Resolution Procedure
          described in

          required, full comment resolution can be achieved by
          a <a>Disposition Vote</a> (see
          section <a href="#Disposition-Vote"></a>). The <a>Project</a>
          Group shall submit the revised document to the <a>Technology

        </p>

        <p>
          If the FCD <a>Ballot</a> passes without Comment, the
          document shall be designated a <a>Draft Publication</a>
          (DP), and the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair shall
          forward the work to the <a>Director of Engineering</a>
          for <a>Standards Committee</a> Audit and preparation for
          publication. (See

        <p>
          If the FCD <a>Ballot</a> passes with Comments,
          the <a>Project</a> Group shall address all comments and

          Resolution Procedure described in
          section <a href="#Comment-Resolution-Process"></a>
          (including one or more <a>Disposition Votes</a>, if

          <p>
            To maintain the integrity and efficiency of the document
            development process, it is essential that there be a
            complete record of all Comment Resolutions made in
            response to a <a>Ballot</a>. After every <a>Ballot</a> and
            prior to further consideration by the <a>Technology
            Committee</a>, the <a>Project</a> Group responsible for a
            document shall prepare three items:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a version of the document clearly showing all the
              changes, relative to the document that
              was <a>Ballot</a>ed, proposed in response to
              the <a>Ballot</a> Comments. The format of this document
              should be redline/strikeout;
            </li>
            <li>
              a clean version (no redlines) of the document; and

              a <a>Comment Resolution Record</a>.
            </li>

          <p>
            These items shall be made available to the <a>Technology

            consider the response(s) and the changes to the revised
            document and to indicate whether their Comment(s) have
            been Resolved. If a commenter does not accept the proposed
            resolution, the commenter shall indicate what specifically
            should be changed to resolve the Comment(s). During the
            initial 2 week period, a commenter may request an
            extension period of an additional 2 weeks, which shall not
            be unreasonably denied. Failure of a commenter to respond
            in any manner within 2 weeks or failure of the commenter
            to indicate specifically why the Comment is not Resolved
            shall be deemed non-responsive, and the Comment shall be
            considered Resolved with the agreement of
            the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair. If any Comments

          meeting, the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair shall appoint
          an <a>Ad Hoc Group</a> to review the list of documents and
          provide recommendations for the disposition of each
          document.  For each document, the disposition recommended
          shall be one of the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Reaffirm
          </li>
          <li>
            Reaffirm and Stabilize
          </li>
          <li>
            Revise
          </li>
          <li>
            Withdraw
          </li>
          <li>
            Reassign the document to another <a>Technology
            Committee</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            No recommendation
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A document should be Reaffirmed if it is believed to be
          substantially correct and does not contain harmful or
          misleading recommendations.
        </p>

        <p>
          A document should be Stabilized if it meets the criteria for
          Reaffirmation, is still relevant to technology or practices
          in use, and need not be subject to future Reviews. It shall
          have been Reaffirmed at least once before.
        </p>

        <p>
          A <a>Stable</a> document still shall be made available and
          offered for sale by the <a>Society</a>, but it shall be
          prefaced by a cover page explaining its current status.
        </p>

        <p>
          At any time, a <a>Technology Committee</a> may revise,
          amend, or otherwise initiate a new <a>Project</a> on
          a <a>Stable</a> document.
        </p>

        <p>
          A document should be <a>Withdrawn</a> only if there is a
          significant possibility of its use causing
          harm. A <a>Withdrawn</a> document still shall be made
          available and offered for sale by the <a>Society</a>, but it
          shall be prefaced by a cover page explaining its current
          status, including a statement that some or all of the
          content is no longer endorsed by the <a>Society</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          A document should be Revised if it does not meet the
          criteria for Reaffirmation or Withdrawal.
        </p>

        <p>
          A document should be Reassigned if it is outside the current
          Scope of the <a>Technology Committee</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The review group shall present its recommendations to
          the <a>Technology Committee</a> for its
          consideration. The <a>Technology Committee</a> shall
          determine whether to accept the review group’s
          recommendations by <a>Consensus Vote</a>. If the vote
          passes, the documents shall be disposed of in accordance
          with the review group’s recommendations and the procedures
          for each process. Any documents determined to be outside
          the <a>Technology Committee</a>’s Scope shall be referred
          back to the <a>Standards Vice President</a> for
          reassignment.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the vote fails, the <a>Technology Committee</a> shall
          first determine whether any of the documents are out of its
          current Scope. If any are, these documents shall be referred
          back to the <a>Standards Vice President</a> for
          reassignment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, provided no alternative process has been started (such
          as a new <a>Project</a> to revise it), for each document
          the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair shall solicit a motion
          for a <a>Consensus Vote</a> to determine whether to
          Reaffirm, or for documents meeting the criteria, whether to
          Reaffirm and Stabilize it. If the <a>Consensus Vote</a>
          passes, the document shall be published
          without <a>Revision</a>, but with a revised date.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the <a>Consensus Vote</a> fails, the <a>Technology
          Committee</a> Chair shall solicit a motion in accordance
          with the procedures in
          Section <a href="#Engineering-Document-Withdrawal-Process"></a>
          for a Vote to determine whether to Withdraw it. If the Vote
          passes, a <a>Ballot</a> to Withdraw the document shall be
          conducted as prescribed in
          Section <a href="#Engineering-Document-Withdrawal-Process"></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the <a>Consensus Vote</a> to Withdraw the document fails,
          the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair shall
          solicit <a>Proponents</a> to Revise the document as a
          New <a>Project</a> in accordance with the Document
          Development Process. If <a>Proponents</a> cannot be found,
          no action shall be required, but the document shall remain
          on the <a>Technology Committee</a>’s agenda until such time
          as <a>Proponents</a> can be found to undertake
          the <a>revision</a>.

          It is sometimes necessary for the <a>Society</a> to be
          represented as a member of other organizations and send a
          delegation to participate in the decision-making processes
          of those organizations. The leader of this delegation shall
          be a Head of Delegation (HOD) who shall be the sole
          communicator of the delegation. Additionally, it is
          sometimes convenient to have a representative present at
          meetings of other organizations to gather information on
          engineering and standardization activities, acting only as a
          facilitator of communications but not presenting an
          official <a>Society</a> position. This shall be
          a <a>Rapporteur</a>.

        <p>
          The <a>Delegates</a> and <a>Rapporteurs</a> shall be

        <h3>Patent Policy</h3>
        <p>
          <a>Engineering Documents</a> may include technology that is
          subject to Essential Claims (see
          section <a href="#Essential-Claims"></a>) but only if all
          known patent holders are prepared to agree to terms that are
          “Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory” (RAND) for all Essential
          Claims. All Engineering Committees and Groups, as described
          in section <a href="#Standards-Committees-and-Groups"></a>,
          are entitled to give preference to technologies that are
          believed to be free of Essential Claims or for which a
          free-of-charge license will be available, provided any such
          solution is believed to be technically adequate. A Committee
          shall not discuss or otherwise consider specific licensing
          terms for such technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important that, whenever possible, Committees are able
          to make a choice of technology based on all relevant
          information, including the existence, or potential
          existence, of any Essential Claims that may encumber a
          technology under consideration.
        </p>

        <p>
          This Policy imposes an obligation on all
          Committee <a>Participant Members</a> and <a>Observer
          Members</a> (Members) and <a>Guests</a>, in accordance with
          section <a href="#Declaration-of-Knowledge-of-Relevant-Intellectual-Property"></a>,
          to notify the <a>Technology Committee</a> Chair, as early as
          possible in the development process if they are aware, based
          on their actual personal knowledge, of patents or patent
          applications, anywhere in the world, that might contain
          Essential Claims to a technology being proposed for

            An Essential Claim is “essential” to an <a>Engineering
            Document</a> only if it is necessarily infringed by
            implementing the <a>Normative Text</a> of
            that <a>Engineering Document</a> and is “necessarily
            infringed” only when there is no commercially-reasonable
            non-infringing alternative for implementing
            the <a>Engineering Document</a>.  Essential Claims to
            an <a>Engineering Document</a> exclude those essential to
            enabling technologies, which are those technologies that
            may be necessary to make or use any implementations but
            are not expressly set forth in the <a>Engineering
            Document</a>.  Essential Claims to an <a>Engineering
            Document</a> also exclude claims essential to
            any <a>Normative Reference</a> included in

            This Policy does not require any patent search and
            specifically recognizes that sponsorship of a Member
            or <a>Guest</a> does not create any obligation to perform
            a patent search.

            This Policy recognizes that all Members and <a>Guests</a>
            act as individuals and that obligations imposed by this
            Operations Manual apply to the Member or <a>Guest</a>
            rather than to any sponsoring organization. For this
            reason, the obligation to disclose is created by the

            This Policy does not require a Member or <a>Guest</a> to
            form a legal opinion as to the applicability or
            enforceability of Essential Claims, but does require a
            disclosure if the Member or <a>Guest</a> has actual
            personal knowledge of a patent or patent application that,
            in the good faith judgment of the Member or <a>Guest</a>,

          <h4>Transfers of Essential Claims</h4>
          <p>
            (a) Each party submitting a Patent Statement shall agree
            that it will not transfer, and confirm that it has not
            transferred, ownership in patents or patent applications
            having Essential Claims for the purpose of circumventing
            such party’s obligations under this Policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            (b) Licensing undertakings made pursuant to this Policy
            shall be interpreted as encumbrances that bind all
            successors-in-interest. Recognizing that this
            interpretation may not be enforceable in all legal
            jurisdictions, any party who has submitted a licensing
            undertaking according to this Policy who transfers
            ownership of any patent or patent application having
            Essential Claims subject to such undertaking shall include
            appropriate provisions in the relevant transfer documents
            to ensure that the undertaking is binding on the
            transferee and that the transferee will similarly include
            appropriate provisions in the event of future transfers
            with the goal of binding all successors-in-interest. The
            undertaking shall be interpreted as binding on
            successors-in-interest regardless of whether such
            provisions are included in the relevant transfer
            documents.

          <p>
            In the event that an Essential Claim is first revealed by
            a Member or <a>Guest</a> following adoption and
            publication of a <a>Engineering Document</a>, the owner or
            controller of the Essential Claim shall be asked to make a
            licensing commitment to the Essential Claim in the same
            manner as if it related to technology proposed for
            adoption by such Member or <a>Guest</a> during the
            development of the <a>Engineering Document</a> in
            question.  If such request is refused, the <a>Engineering
            Document</a> in question shall be referred back to the
            relevant <a>Technology Committee</a> for consideration and
            possible action.

            All commitments made under this Policy shall be
            irrevocable, except that the owner of an Essential Claim
            may include a “reciprocity” or “defensive suspension” term
            in a license to its Essential Claims.  For purposes of
            this policy, (a) reciprocity shall mean that a licensor
            may require a licensee to provide a reciprocal RAND
            license with respect to any Essential Claim(s) owned by
            the licensee with respect to the same <a>Engineering
            Document</a>, and (b) defensive suspension shall mean that
            a licensor may revoke a license granted to an implementer
            if that implementer asserts an Essential Claim (other than
            under RAND license terms) in connection with the
            same <a>Engineering Document</a> against the licensor or
            its Affiliates.
          </p>

          <p>
            An Affiliate of a party shall mean a company or other
            legal entity which now or, hereafter, controls or is
            controlled by or is under common control with such party,
            but any such company or other legal entity shall be deemed
            to be an Affiliate only as long as such control exists,
            and for the purposes of this definition, “control” shall
            mean direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the
            voting power, capital or other securities of the
            controlled or commonly controlled entity.

            relating to an Essential Claim(s) under such document with
